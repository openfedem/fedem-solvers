# FEDEM solvers Changelog

## [fedem-8.0.9] (2025-03-18)

### :rocket: Added

- New method `fedempy.modeler.make_generic_part()`
- The method `fedempy.fmm_solver.solve_all()` is extended with option
  to export the model and response (transformations, deformations and
  von Mises stress on FE parts) to a VTFx-file during the simulation.
  Requires the Ceetron VTFx exporter plugin (not part of openfedem).
- Progress bar when running the solver from console using the methods
  `fedempy.fmm_solver.solve_all()` and `fedempy.solver.run_all()`.

### :bug: Fixed

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-foundation/issues/25 :
  A specified external function file should be overridden if function
  values are assigned explicitly from a fedempy script.
- The dynamics solver may crash if invoked twice from the same fedempy script,
  if the model file is saved before the simulation is started.
- If the dynamics solver diverges during time integration, the end section
  of the fedem_solver.res file (with timing information, etc.) is missing.

## [fedem-8.0.8] (2025-01-04)

### :rocket: Added

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/issues/18 :
  Time-dependent mass scaling on superelements.
- Print traceback to console on segmentation fault for Debug build on Linux.

### :bug: Fixed

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/issues/21 :
  Incorrect stress calculation for the 20-noded HEX element.

## [fedem-8.0.6] (2024-10-18)

### :rocket: Added

- Binaries for the solvers are automatically built for the Linux platform
  whenever a new release tag is pushed, and attached as an artifact together with
  the fedempy package on the [Releases](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/releases) page.
- The FMU wrapper for the FEDEM solvers is built for both Windows and Linux platforms
  and deployed as a separate release, whenever a tag named `fmu-*` is pushed.
- The auto-generated source code tar-balls associated with each release are now empty,
  since they will be incomplete anyway (missing submodule parts).

### :bug: Fixed

- https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/issues/32 :
  Wrong data format in the FMU shared object library.
  Also handle missing definition of environment variable FEDEM_SOLVER in the FMU,
  such that is does not crash but exits with a console error message.

## [fedem-8.0.5] (2024-09-27)

### :rocket: Added

- The fedempy package is automatically built whenever a new release tag is pushed,
  and is deployed on the [Releases](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/releases) page.
- The regression and unit tests are automatically built and executed
  whenever a new pull request is opened or updated.

### :bug: Fixed

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-foundation/issues/11 :
  This may sometimes cause the solver to crash if evaluating the function
  outside its definition domain, when extrapolation is to take place.

## [fedem-8.0.4] (2024-07-12)

### :bug: Fixed

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/issues/3 :
  Not possible to perform stress recovery for more than one part during dynamics solve.

## [fedem-8.0.3] (2024-06-13)

### :rocket: Added

- Source code documentation generated by doxygen/sphinx is automatically built
  whenever a new release tag is pushed, and is published on the github pages
  [here](https://openfedem.github.io/fedem-solvers/).
- Support for L-profiles from PBEAML-records in Nastran bulk data files.
- Account for non-symmetric beam cross sections from Nastran bulk data files.
- An optional `time_next` argument is added to the `start_step()` method
  of the `fedempy.solver.FedemSolver` class, working in the same way as
  the `time_next` argument of the `solve_next()` method.
- The FE part reducer will now continue (with a warning message) when zero-area
  shell elements are detected, instead of aborting the reduction process.

### :bug: Fixed

- The torsional stiffness constant calculated from PBARL/PBEAML records
  is incorrect for some beam cross section shapes.

## [fedem-8.0.1] (2024-01-25)

### :rocket: Added

- The frequency domain solution methods are reinstated,
  using the FFTPACK 5.1 library which now is embedded in this repository.

### :bug: Fixed

- (Cosmetic) A newline follows the object description in the frs-file header.
- Direct curve export from the dynamics solver does not work,
  due do the issue [SAP/fedem-gui#5](https://github.com/SAP/fedem-gui/issues/5).

## fedem-8.0.0 (2023-12-21)

### :rocket: Added
